# EM-Algorithm-slow
This Python Code is a very very slow implementation of the expectation-maximization algorithm
that only works with two tetas/two dimensional matrizes.
It contains a small data set and chooses the first teta values at random.
Your output should be:
[[0.77703737 0.22296263]
 [0.15063776 0.84936224]
 [0.17872374 0.82127626]
 [0.34894962 0.65105038]
 [0.16386842 0.83613158]]
 For a quicker result decrease the accuracy of the matrixchanged() function or just 
 put all of this into ChatGPT. You could also always start by estimating your teta 
 values first instead of chosing them at random. In additiion, python works a 
 lot faster with dictionaries than with lists, so you could change that. I am only 
 starting to learn python and prioritized coding speed over execution speed.
